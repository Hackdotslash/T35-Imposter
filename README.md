# Introduction:drop_of_blood::hospital:
This Web-App is Based on the Theme 'Rural Health Development'.<br><br>
<img src="refer/home.png">
<br><br>Considering people in the Rural Areas do not have much access to Internet facility and might also not have an E-mail ID so considering all these factors our Web-App provides the best for them.<br>
We have created a Simple Application which reduces complexity as much as possible so that people can make blood request when Urgent without any tedious operations.<br>
Considering People in Rural areas will not keep a track of verification from the Blood Bank once requested the Blood Bank will take people's Data from our Web-App and Contact them. It is just a platform to convey the message to the blood banks about the details of patient requiring blood.
Every Registerd Blood Bank will be provided with a Unique ID which they will use to Access all the Requests. This is done so that no leyman can access any patient's information. <br>

# How it works :thinking:?
## Registration Page For Blood Banks 
This is the registration form for Blood Banks providing their relevant information.<br><br>
