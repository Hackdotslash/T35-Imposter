# Rapid Red :drop_of_blood::hospital:
Facing difficulties in finding blood when needed and not able to ask a group of people without making a dozen calls?:cry:Willing to donate blood but don't want it to get wasted and really want to help?:cry:Then this site will help you to find donor as well as reciever.:star_struck:.
If you want to contact a nearby bloodbank you can find their contact info also.

# How it works :thinking:
If you need blood, then just fill out a form with relevant information and after that donors and blood banks will contact you themselves.
Blood banks are registered here, so you can even find their contact info if needed.
