This Web-App is Based on the Theme 'Rural Health Development'.<br>
Considering people in the Rural Areas do not have much access to Internet facility and might also not have an E-mail ID so considering all these factors our Web-App provides the best for them.<br>
We have created a Simple Application which reduces complexity as much as possible so that people can make blood request when Urgent without any tedious operation.<br>
Considering People in Rural areas will not keep a track of verification from the Blood Bank once requested the Blood Bank will take people's Data from our Web-App and Contact them Them.<br>
Every Registerd Blood Bank will be provided with a Unique ID which they will use to Access all the Requests. This is Done so that no leman can access Any patient's info. <br>

# How it works :thinking:?
